// simple loan interest calculator that calculates the total loan payment based on the principal, interest rate, and loan period.

// ● loanPeriod should be at least 1 year.
// Example: If a user inputs an interest rate above 100% or a loan period of less than 1 year,

// Uses the simple interest formula: Total = Principal + (Principal * Rate * Years / 100) to calculate the total amount payable.
